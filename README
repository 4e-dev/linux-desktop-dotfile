Dotfiles
========

Personal dotfiles for Wayland setups.

This repo contains my linux configurations.
It aims to be minimal and be keyboard-driven via Sway.

Directory Overview
------------------

alacritty/
    terminal emulator configuration

sway/
    window manager configuration (like i3)

tmux/
    terminal multiplexer configuration.

vim/
    editor configuration.

waybar/
    status bar configuration for Wayland.

wofi/
    application launcher configuration.

Usage
-----

These dotfiles are intended to be symlinked into the appropriate locations
under ~/.config or ~/, for example:

    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/sway ~/.config/sway
    ln -s ~/.dotfiles/alacritty ~/.config/alacritty

Adjust paths as needed for your system.

Notes
-----

- Assumes a Wayland environment
- Expect to install dependencies manually (sway, waybar, wofi, alacritty, tmux, vim)

License
